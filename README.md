# About Celia Claire Project
Celia Claire MD is a bot built with the Baileys library. It is a basic bot designed for learning and exploration. It already supports Pairing Code, but unfortunately, it does not work in Termux terminals for some reason. So yes, you can only run it on panels like Pterodactyl.
